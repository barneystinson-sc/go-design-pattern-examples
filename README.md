### Livestream Notification Service
Golang implementations of common design patterns


### Build project
This project is configured to support [fresh](https://github.com/gravityblast/fresh) runner which reloads the application actively whenever any golang file (or any other file configured for hot reloading) changes. This is very useful while actively developing as it removes the need to recompile and run the application again and again. `runner.conf` in the root directory is used to configure the fresh runner. More information can be viewed on [their github project](https://github.com/gravityblast/fresh)
Also you may use `go run main.go`
